# ECS171-Movie-Rec

This repository contains the code and resources for the ECS171 Movie Recommendation System, a research project by Kyle Carbonell, Eugene Cho, Patrick Yao, and Brayan Torres Vega (2025).

## Project Overview

This project explores content-based movie recommendation using the IMDb Top 1000 dataset. The system uses only movie features (plot, genre, director, cast, ratings) to recommend similar moviesâ€”no user data required.

- **Modern web app**: React + Tailwind CSS frontend, Flask + Poetry backend
- **Multiple models**: Compare different feature sets and algorithms
- **Research context**: Each model represents a different experiment from our report

## Quick Start

See [`Webapp/README.md`](Webapp/README.md) for detailed setup, usage, and project structure instructions.
